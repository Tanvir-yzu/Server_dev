**A Django-based backend server application.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

Server_dev is a backend application built using the Django framework.  Based on the provided code, it appears to be a project in its early stages of development. The primary purpose is currently unclear without more complete code, but the presence of `manage.py` strongly suggests a Django project.  Further analysis of the `Auth`, `DevOps`, and `examples` folders will reveal more details upon expansion of the project.


## ✨ Features

* **Django Framework:**  The application utilizes the Django framework for backend logic and structure.
* **Project Management (Potential):** The inclusion of example folders suggests a potential focus on creating and managing projects, but this remains speculative until more code is available for analysis.
* **Authentication (Potential):**  The `Auth` directory hints at future implementation of an authentication system.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (version needs to be specified once requirements are available)
-  A virtual environment is strongly recommended for development.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanvir-yzu/Server_dev.git
   cd Server_dev
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv  # or your preferred virtual environment creation method
   source .venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # activate the virtual environment (Windows)
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
  This requires more information from a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.  This step will be updated once dependencies are identified.


4. **Run Migrations (Once Dependencies are Installed):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start development server (Once Dependencies are Installed):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Open your browser:** Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
